# lbaw2251 - About Fashion

Welcome to the documentation pages of the About Fashion system!

You can find here detailed information about the product, from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions, a kind of Software Development Report, organized by discipline:

* Requirements Specification
    * [ER Component](ER__Requirements_Specification_Component.md)

So far, contributions are exclusively made by the initial team, but we hope to open them to the community, in all areas and topics: requirements, technologies, development, experimentation, testing, etc.

Please contact us!

Thank you!
